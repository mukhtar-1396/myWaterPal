        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <br />
        <h2 class="display-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lead">My Water Pal is an idea come to life on this web application, to allow users to track their daily intake of water. The purpose for this application is to allow and encourage users to reach their daily water consumption goal to ensure a healthy lifestyle. Below you will find information to the importance of a certain amount of water per day alongside the health benefits it provides. You can also meet the team behind My Water Pal further along.</p>

        <br />
        <h2 class="display-4">Information</h2>
        <p class="lead">Drinking Water Helps Maintain the Balance of Body Fluids. Your body is composed of about 60% water. The functions of these bodily fluids include digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature. Considering this, to replenish the water lost due to these functions is a must, if the body doesn’t get water then these functions won’t be able to do what they do to enable your body to survive. </p>
        <p class="lead">Below are the harms of not drinking enough water:</p>
        <br />
        <ul id="harms" style="list-style-type:none;" class="lead">
            <li>
                Dehydration
                <ul>
                    <li>More than half your body weight comes from water. So if your levels are off, it can show up in a surprising number of ways. Mild dehydration can make you feel tired, give you a headache, and affect your mood and focus. And when you push yourself hard at the gym, all that sweating actually lowers how much blood you have for a bit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Bad Breath
                <ul>
                    <li>Water is essential for saliva production and helps rinse away bacteria so you can maintain healthy teeth and gums. Lack of water inhibits saliva production and causes bacteria to build up on the tongue, teeth, and gums, contributing to bad breath. If you practice good oral hygiene, yet continue suffering from chronic bad breath, it’s possible you may not be drinking enough water. Make an appointment with your doctor if bad breath persists after increasing your water intake to rule out other underlying causes such as gum disease, type 2 diabetes, and liver or kidney problems.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Frequent Illness
                <ul>
                    <li>Water helps flush toxins, waste, and bacteria from the body to fight disease and infection as well as strengthens your immune system so you become sick less frequently. If it seems as though you’re always getting sick, you may need to start drinking more water to keep your body free of toxins and functioning at an optimal level. Since lack of water also causes fatigue, you may tend to be less physically active—another risk factor for weakened immunity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">Now that we have you worried about what happens when you dont drink enough water, we will inform you on the benefits. Aside from doing the opposite of what is mentioned above, here are a few more benefits of drinking lots of water:</p>
        <br />
        <ul id="harms" style="list-style-type:none;" class="lead">
            <li>
                Digestion
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One of the most notorious consequences of not getting enough water is constipation. Much like the cartilage conundrum, if your body is dehydrated, your digestive system is one of the areas that has to sacrifice its fluid levels for the greater good.
                        Your gut absorbs water from your poo, causing (for want of a better phrase) an uncomfortable backlog. This will only be dislodged by re-hydrating as soon as possible to smooth the digestion journey and returning bowel movements to normal
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Blood Circulation
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Over half your blood consists of a substance called plasma. It carries blood cells around your body to where they’re needed, helps maintain a healthy blood pressure and keeps your body temperature under control.
                        In short, it’s pretty important.
                        Plasma is around 90% water, so it can’t do its job properly if you’re dehydrated. Without enough water, your blood will become thicker and more concentrated. This means your heart has to work that little bit harder to pump it around your body
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Weight Loss Assistance
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You may have heard the claim that drinking water will help you lose weight. Sadly, this isn’t quite accurate. Look at this way. If you have a poor diet, a few glasses of water here and there isn’t going to stop you from piling on the pounds.
                        What water can do is help you change your eating habits. Drinking water before a meal will fill you up a little and, provided you eat at a moderate pace and allow your brain time to catch up with your stomach, you may eat less as a result. This, in turn, could help you lose some weight
